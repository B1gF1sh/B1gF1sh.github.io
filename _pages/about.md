Hi, I am Berk Ali Demir, a senior year computer engineering student at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/). 

My main interests are Computer Architecture, CPU Design, and Digital Electronics Design.
I enjoy working on processor microarchitecture, parallel programming, and hardware design projects, and Iâ€™m aiming to contribute to the field of semiconductor and high-performance computing.
